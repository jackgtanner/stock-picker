#Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, 
#one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing 
#the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.


# Quick Tips:

# You need to buy before you can sell
# Pay attention to edge cases like when the lowest day is the last day or the highest day is the first day.






  def stock_picker(prices)
    #Store everything in the array 'prices'
    max_profit_per_day = []
    

    # for each number in Prices, and calculate the max possible
    # profit if you bought on that day
    prices.each_with_index do |buy_price, buy_day|

            # Get all the remaining days after the current buy_day.
            remaining = prices[buy_day + 1..-1]
            
            # Use an array to store the data for the current day
            possible_profit = []

            # Iterate over all the remaining days and calculate the profit if you
            # were to sell on that day.
            remaining.each_with_index do |sell_price, sell_day|

            # format the data and store the data in an array
            possible_profit.push([sell_price - buy_price, buy_day, sell_day + buy_day + 1])

        end
    
        # Sort the possible profits for the day and push the highest one to the
        # max_profit_per_day array.
        max_profit_per_day[buy_day] = possible_profit.sort.pop
    
      end
    
    # Get rid of the nil value, and sort the array, and store the most profitable
    # day in an array.
    when_to_buy_and_sell = max_profit_per_day.compact.sort.pop
    
    # shift the profit out of the array
    when_to_buy_and_sell.shift
    
    # return the day to buy and sell
    when_to_buy_and_sell

    p "You should have bought on day #{when_to_buy_and_sell[0]} and sold on day #{when_to_buy_and_sell[1]} for a profit of: Â£#{max_profit_per_day.compact.sort.pop}"
